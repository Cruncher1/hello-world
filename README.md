So, this is my first repository on GitHub. 

I don't have anything to add to that sentiment at this time.

about myself:

I was a comp sci major - for a year. 
Hey, I build a mountain biking webpage in 1993. 
That was at a time before most people had ever even heard of the internet. 
But, my interests were stronger in microbio which stole me away from CS in short order. 
So, I never finished CS. But something about it stuck. 

I loved logic. I think that is what stuck.

Later on I branched of a hundred more times but came back to CS and taught myself Java. 
I didn't like Java at all despite wanting to. 
Along the way I discovered AHK. It could accomplish what I was trying to code much more quickly and easily. 
I loved AHK and still do. It streamlines my daily life. It is a tool worthy of more respect than it garners. 
I developed a beautiful desktop app with it that I have used daily for years to streamline my worklife. 

Nonetheless, I moved onto Python. I love coding in Python now. 
I also enjoy C++, but in my heart, it is 2nd to Python.

Python's weakness (one of them) is in the GUI dept. 
This is something that frustrates me since AHK makes GUI's and Message boxes so easy. 
    Example: Creating a Hello World Windows Message box in ahk takes a single line of code
    Msgbox, Hello World
    Yep, just 3 words. 

In any case. I am committing myself to improving my Python skills and learning to build GUI's in Python. 
GitHub is to be part of that journey.
